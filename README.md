Abstract:
<ul>
  <li>A Faculty Portal for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) is proposed to enable students to easily access faculty information from various universities.</li>
  <li>Students can search for faculty details based on criteria such as Name, Department, Designation, Qualification, Specialization, Courses, and Research Interest.</li>
  <li>This system aims to assist students in selecting the best institute for higher studies by providing comprehensive faculty profiles.</li>
  <li>By consolidating faculty information from multiple universities into one platform, students' efforts in searching and comparing faculty across institutions will be minimized.</li>
</ul>

Introduction:
<ul>
  <li>The proposed Faculty Portal for HEIs allows students to view profiles of teachers from different universities.</li>
  <li>Teachers from various universities can register on the portal and upload their CVs and information.</li>
  <li>The portal includes data from at least ten Higher Education Commission (HEC) universities.</li>
  <li>Complete information of teachers, including name, designation, experience, email address, office phone number, qualification, specialization, and serving institute, is stored in the system.</li>
  <li>Faculty profiles are organized institute-wise on the home page, and students can search for faculty details using various criteria.</li>
  <li>Upon clicking on a faculty member's name, users are directed to a detailed web page containing tabs for "Profile", "Publications", "Conferences, Seminars, and Workshops", and "Experience", where relevant information is provided.</li>
  <li>Administration of the portal is managed by an admin user.</li>
  <li>The database is maintained to support the functionality described.</li>
</ul>
